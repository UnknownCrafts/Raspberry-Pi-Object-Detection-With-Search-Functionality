# Raspberry-Pi-Object-Detection-With-Search-Functionality
A Grade 12 Computer Engineering Project

Here is the original repository: https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/raspberry_pi

After opening a terminal where the this folder exists do "sh setup.sh" to install the required dependencies

Other than that the models are already provided in this github repo.

Thanks to the tensorflow project for the base code and AI models!
